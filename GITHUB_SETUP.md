# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Quick Setup Instructions

Your STL Viewer project is ready for GitHub! Here are the steps to create and push to a GitHub repository:

### Option 1: Using GitHub CLI (Recommended)

1. **Authenticate with GitHub:**
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```
   Follow the prompts to authenticate with your GitHub account.

2. **Create the repository:**
   ```bash
   gh repo create stl-viewer --public --description "A Qt6-based 3D STL file viewer with OpenGL rendering"
   ```

3. **Push your code:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stl-viewer.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 2: Using GitHub Web Interface

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `stl-viewer`
   - Description: `A Qt6-based 3D STL file viewer with OpenGL rendering`
   - Make it public
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Add the remote and push:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stl-viewer.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 3: One-command setup (if authenticated)

If you're already authenticated with GitHub CLI:
```bash
gh repo create stl-viewer --public --description "A Qt6-based 3D STL file viewer with OpenGL rendering" --remote=origin --push
```

## Project Status

✅ Git repository initialized  
✅ All source files committed  
✅ .gitignore configured  
✅ README.md with complete documentation  
✅ Build system ready  
✅ Example STL file included  

## Repository Structure

Your repository will contain:
- Complete Qt6/OpenGL STL viewer application
- Cross-platform CMake build system
- Comprehensive documentation
- Example STL files for testing
- Professional .gitignore file

## After Creating the Repository

Consider adding these GitHub-specific files:
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `LICENSE` - Open source license
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD workflows
- Issue and PR templates

## Build Badge

After setting up CI/CD, you can add a build badge to your README:
```markdown
[![Build Status](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stl-viewer/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stl-viewer/actions)
```
